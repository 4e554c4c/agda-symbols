# Agda symbols

An open repository of
[Agda](https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php) symbols for use
in various text editors.


## Motivation

Many Agda editor integrations
(emacs
[agda-mode](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools/emacs-mode.html),
vscode
[agda-mode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=banacorn.agda-mode),
[Cornelis](https://github.com/agda/cornelis), etc.) exist. These all
define their own methods to input unicode symbols that are widely used
by agda libraries. This repository attempts to consolodate these
completions into a single place.

## Contributing

PRs for new symbols and aliases are always welcome.

## Credits

All completions are taken originally from [cmp-agda-symbols](https://github.com/Arkissa/cmp-agda-symbols).
